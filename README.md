# BUSINESS_INSIGHTS - 360
My First Power BI Project.
## Project Overview : 
 AtliQ Hardware a consumer goods electronics company having operations in various countries. Their business is growing rapidly and they still rely on excel files for data analytics. Excel files are hard to consume and not effective in generating insights. Due to the lack of effective analytics the company faced a major loss in Latin America.
Thus, senior executives of this company have decided to invest in a data analytics project and have assigned a team for this work.

I had completed this project by following the Codebasics PowerBI Course. You can check the course [here](https://codebasics.io/courses/power-bi-data-analysis-with-end-to-end-project).

 ## About Company
AltiQ hardware is a company which has grown vastly in the recent years, and opened business all over the globe. It is a company which sells, computer and computer accessories through three mediums/channel
 - Retailers
 - Direct
 - Distributors
Recently the company has faced a unforeseen loss by opening store in America based on the surveys, intuition and some excel analysis and also the companyâ€™s competitors has handful of analytics team to perform analysis and make data driven decision. So, the AltiQ hardware has no other option other than building their analytics team for data driven insights and decisions in the future to survive competitively in the industry.
## Things to consider before starting to build the project
Sometimes business managers may give a data analyst a very rough requirements for the projects. Then its a responsibility of a data analyst to ask counter questions and to clarify requirements. So its better to clarify things first, rather than asking them later! Thus we will be able to set realistics expectations. Last but not the least, a data anaylyst has to be very upfront and clear - For e.g., While working on the project a data analyst will not allow too many changes in the report (Feature Creep).
 ### Questions to be asked before the project gets started - 
- What is the primary objective for building this Power BI report ?
- What are the hopes & fears (expectations) does stakeholders have for this project ?
- What is project deadline ?
- What problem are we trying to solve ?
- How the success of this project will be measured ?
- What are the risks involved in creating this project ?
- Additional resources required for buidling the report ?
- Who are all will be using this dashboard and for what purpose?
- Is there any feedback from stakeholders on the design and views of the dashboard?
### Discovering Datasets
